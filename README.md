# Wikidata Explorer

Methods to explore wikidata content and to compare it with other sources of different nature. Currently implemented:

- Count number of apparitions of each property in wikidata database. It works against a locally stored json dump.
- Extract description, labels and aliases for a given set of properties specified through a file. It works against an API
- Scrap Google Trends to find queries related with labels or alias of properties.
- Count number of n-grams apparitions (with different size of n) in AOL. It works using a local dump.
